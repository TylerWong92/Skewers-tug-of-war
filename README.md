A readme.md file with:
Explanations of the technologies used
A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took
Link to your wireframes â€“ sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles your team had to overcome
Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks (use prettier). DO NOT leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice). Comments, if in your code at all, should be in your code to describe what your functions are doing.
Display proper use of global variables and function parameters (function scopes)
Use camelCase for JavaScript variables
